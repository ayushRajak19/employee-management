# MobiusEMS System Architecture Specification

## 1. System Boundaries & Runtime Separation

MobiusEMS is an independent enterprise-grade workforce capability, work delivery, performance intelligence, and commercial operations platform engineered for `employee.whalexy.com`.

- **Autonomous Runtime**: MobiusEMS runs on Node.js 20+ and Express 4. It does not share memory, filesystem, or database infrastructure with the legacy Laravel application at `whalexy.com`.
- **API & SPA Topology**: In production, the Express server hosts the REST API mounted under `/api/v1/*` and statically serves the production-compiled React 19 SPA (`client/dist`) with an immutable client-side asset caching strategy and single-page application (SPA) routing fallback.
- **Tenant Boundary**: Multi-tenancy is enforced at the persistence layer using a central fail-closed Mongoose model wrapper and Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage`. Every database query, aggregation, mutation, and background job is strictly bound to the authenticated tenant.

## 2. Monorepo Structure & Package Responsibilities

MobiusEMS is architected as an npm workspace monorepo divided into three decoupled packages:

## 4. Comprehensive Domain & Model Map (62 Models)

Every business collection enforces an immutable `tenantId` leading compound index, soft-deletion timestamps (`isActive`, `archivedAt`, `deletedAt`), and strict service-level field allowlisting:

| Domain | Key Collections / Models | Architectural Responsibility |

## 5. API Routing Topology (19 Top-Level Modules)

The Express router (`server/src/routes/index.ts`) mounts 19 modular route controllers under `/api/v1`:

```text
/api/v1/auth                 Authentication lifecycle (login, refresh, logout, session verification)
/api/v1/registration         Tenant and employee onboarding & registration pipelines
/api/v1/dashboard            Role-scoped operational metrics and dashboard aggregations

/api/v1/employee-map         Geospatial workforce distribution and office location mapping
```

## 6. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation Engine

Multi-tenancy in MobiusEMS is implemented as an architectural invariant, not an optional filter:

1. **AsyncLocalStorage Execution Context**: When a request arrives, authentication middleware verifies the JWT and establishes a request-isolated context containing `tenantId` and `isPlatformAdmin`.
2. **Fail-Closed Mongoose Model Wrapper**: Every tenant-owned model is registered through `withTenancy()`. The wrapper intercepts:
   - Queries (`find`, `findOne`, `countDocuments`): Automatically appends `{ tenantId }` to the query predicate. Conflicting tenant IDs provided in parameters trigger a fail-closed exception.
   - Mutations (`updateOne`, `updateMany`, `findOneAndUpdate`, `deleteMany`): Injects `{ tenantId }` into the query filter.
   - Insertions (`save`, `insertMany`): Injects `tenantId` into document payloads prior to validation.
   - Aggregations (`aggregate`): Automatically prepends a `$match: { tenantId }` pipeline stage as stage 0.
   - Direct Object Access (IDOR Prevention): Cross-tenant access by raw MongoDB `_id` is fundamentally rejected because queries always evaluate `_id AND tenantId`.
3. **Tenant-Local Uniqueness**: Unique business identifiers (email, employee ID, project code, department code, customer email) are indexed with tenant-leading compound unique indexes: `{ tenantId: 1, email: 1 }`.
4. **Global Platform Entities**: Only `Tenant` and `Permission` bypass tenant scoping. Access to `/api/v1/platform/*` endpoints requires the `SUPER_ADMIN` role and email allowlisting in `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS`.

## 7. AI & Voice Architecture

### 7.1 Multi-Provider LLM Abstraction
The AI service (`llmService.ts`) abstracts upstream LLM providers behind a unified interface:
- **Default Provider**: Groq running `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for ultra-low latency inference.
- **Alternative Providers**: OpenAI (`gpt-4.1-mini`), Anthropic (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`), Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`), Together (`Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo`), OpenRouter, and generic OpenAI-compatible gateways.
- **Execution Parameters**: Deterministic low temperature (`0.2`), strict token budgets (default 900 tokens), and configurable abort timeouts (`AI_TIMEOUT_MS = 45000`).
- **Employment Decision Boundary**: AI output is strictly advisory. AI is prohibited by policy and code from making autonomous promotion, termination, salary, or disciplinary decisions.
- **Deterministic Math Separation**: All quantitative scoring (KPI calculation, performance scoring, contribution index, sales conversion rates, opportunity scoring) is executed by deterministic TypeScript math modules, completely decoupled from LLM generation.

### 7.2 Local Zero-Retention Voice-to-Task Pipeline
- **Speech-to-Text Engine**: Server-side local transcription powered by `faster-whisper` (`small` multilingual model, `int8` quantization). Eliminates recurring per-minute cloud STT costs.
- **Zero-Retention Audio Handling**: Audio received by the server is written to an ephemeral `mkdtemp` directory, transcribed by a local Python worker, and immediately wiped via `fs.rm` in a `finally` block. No voice audio is stored in persistent storage or databases.
- **Multilingual Heuristic NLP**: A dedicated 400+ line multilingual parsing engine (`voiceTaskService.ts`) supports English and 10 major Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Urdu).
- **Interactive Review**: Voice commands are converted into structured `VoiceDraft` previews allowing employees and managers to verify or edit assignees, estimated hours, and project associations before saving.

## 8. Deterministic Scoring & Analytics Engines

To eliminate algorithmic hallucination and ensure audit compliance, all core scores are computed deterministically:

1. **Performance Engine (`performanceMath.ts`)**: Computes weighted scores across Goals, Role KPIs, and Review Competencies based on tenant-configured weighting templates. Generates immutable `PerformanceSnapshot` records preserving raw inputs, weight formulas, and final grade brackets (`EXCEEDING`, `MEETING`, `NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT`, `UNSATISFACTORY`).
2. **Contribution Engine (`contributionMath.ts`)**: Evaluates employee weekly updates, project deliverables, and manager ratings into standardized contribution percentiles.
3. **Sales & Commercial Engine (`salesMath.ts`)**:
   - Computes weighted pipeline values, conversion velocity, and target achievements.
   - Bounded opportunity scoring: Evaluates lead demand score, coverage gap score, customer white space score, and pipeline potential score into normalized opportunity bands (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`).
   - Calculates estimated lost conversion revenue from delayed follow-ups using tenant SLA configurations.

## 9. Security & Governance Invariants

- **Session Security**: Dual-token pattern using HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies. Refresh tokens rotate upon renewal; reuse attempts invalidate the entire session family.
- **Origin Guard**: `verifyRequestOrigin` middleware validates mutating HTTP requests against `CLIENT_URL` to block Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Private Document Management**: Uploads are stored in Cloudinary as authenticated private assets with cryptographically random identifiers. Download URLs are short-lived and signed only after backend authorization checks.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: The `AuditLog` collection records actor identity, IP, user agent, target entity, action type, and diff snapshots. No update or delete endpoints exist in the application.
